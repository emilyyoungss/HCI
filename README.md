Alcohol awareness tracker - allows individual users to input how much alcohol they have had each day. At the end of week it gives you a unit counter which tells you your total consumption for the week and if you have gone over the limit - how much by. This will be targetted at students and showing the effects binge drinking is having on their health.
The user can view this data on day by day consumption, or by aggregate consumption per week.
